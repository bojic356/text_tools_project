Do you need a reason to not want to lose
Being the best decoy ever is as cool as being the ace
You can fly even higher
If they adjust to me I have to adjust in turn Whoever stops adjusting won t be able to continue forward
The last ones standing are the victors Only the strongest If you want to be the last one standing become strong
Life s a bore if you don t challenge yourself
There are some flowers you only see when you take detours
Being weak means that there is room to grow
Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom
If you re gonna hit it hit it until it breaks
"If you think too hard when you don't have a brain, you're going to hurt your head."
"If you're gonna hit it, hit it until it breaks!"
"Is ""defeat"" proof that you are weak? Isn't ""defeat"" more like a trial to overcome? Of whether you can stand up and walk again after falling to you knees? If you remain on your knees like that, then it would be a sign of weakness."

"Talent is something you make bloom, instinct is something you polish."
The last ones standing are the victors. Only the strongest. If you want to be the last one standing become strong.
"We're basically developing at this point, and we don't know the limits of our potential. Even if we felt those limits we would still keep aiming higher."
Y-you actually used your head??? You're going to get a fever!
But now we can fight. Even if they read us or catch up to us...
"When 'colors' mix, they become muddy and messy. But when they all blend together, the final result is the color that wins against all others... Black."

"Before my eyes, it blocks my path. A high, high wall. What sort of scene is on the other side? What will I be able to see there? “The view from the top”. A scenery I will never be able to see on my own. But if I’m not alone, then... I might be able to see it."
"Once my stomach settles down... You better be prepared, 'cause we'll really give you something to cry about in the mat... ugh... ch... uughh..."
It's true that I'm not very tall. However! I can jump!
"I kept the ball in the air, it’s not your place to give up."
You don’t win alone. That’s just how it is.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
"Little by little, what you’ve begun will naturally become important to you. What you need at the start is a little bit of curiosity."
Because people don't have wings... We look for ways to fly.
"Does losing prove that you are weak? Isn't losing difficult for all of you? A challenge where, after ending up on your hands and knees, you must see if you can stand up again? If you stay on your hands and knees, that proves that you are weak."
"Even if we're not confident that we'll win, even if others tell us we don't stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that."
Being weak means that there is a room to grow.
"It's best to go up against strong guys, if you want to get stronger."
"Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, or next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think that it will never come, it probably never will."
"Birds with the wind in their wings are flying across the great blue sky right now. And all of you should be able to make it! To the highest limit, to the farthest limit!"
"You need someone else to become more disciplined. No matter how hard you try by yourself, there´s a limit."
Someone who can't see the opponent before them can't see the opponent lying beyond.
"Even if you put aside regret, you´ll end up feeling it anyway. Right now, you need to make sure you grasp this good feeling and never forget it."
"There's no match you can't win, and there's no match that you'll win for sure."
