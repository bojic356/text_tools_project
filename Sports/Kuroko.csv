"Human minds are not designed to accept negative statements like ‘don’t do this’ or ‘I can’t do that’, ‘we can’t make any mistakes’, ‘failure is not accepted’. These kinds of thoughts only serve to counter productively stress the body and lead to further mistakes. And if just one mistake is made, it turns into a vicious cycle. The more they think about it, the more mistakes will be made, and the more the quality of their plays will drop."
"What are you good at, what do you like… You need to show something that makes people understand who you are."

When you come to hate something you liked it is incredibly painful.
"If we give our best in something we love, we'll enjoy the victories from the bottom of our hearts."
"* The Zone * In this state of extreme focus, all unnecessary thoughts disappear and the athlete becomes absorbed in his play. Only those who have practiced and practiced earn the right to stand before the door, and it only opens unpredictably. It is the ultimate domain, open only to the chosen."
We cannot be satisfied until we have eliminated all others. It has nothing to do with reason. It is instinct.
"No matter how many more points you have at the end of the game, if you're not happy, that's not a victory."
Winning is everything in this world. The victors write history. The losers are wiped from it.
Break them and they're all just trash.
"It's not about doing what it takes to win. Sei-chan told me before ""Winning is just like breathing"". Victory isn't something that Sei-chan seeks. It's a natural part of his life. It's a basic bodily function."
"It’s not the time to be scared. Of course it’s better if the opponent is strong rather than weak, right!"

"They say some defeats are meaningful and losing makes you stronger. Do you understand what that means? For living creatures victory is life, and defeat means death. It's an extreme example, but humans retain that instinct. Those who know the terror of defeat, hunger for victory."
"If you haven't changed, that means you haven't improved."
We'll worry about the future once we get there.
Do you think everyone can make their dreams come true through hard work? Hard work isn't always rewarded.

There's no such thing as useless effort.
"For living creatures, Victory if Life, and Defeat means Death."
"If there's no one happy, is it really a victory?"
"When I tell you to leave, leave. In this world, winning is everything. Winners are affirmed completely, and losers are denied completely. I've never lost at anything before, and I never will. Because I always win, and I'm always right. I show no mercy to those who oppose me, not even my own parents."
This is our show. We're the ones who are writing the script.
How you change is up to you.
"The past and the future are not the same, but they're not completely separate either."

"I am a supporting actor, a shadow. But a shadow will become darker if the light is stronger and it will make the white of the light stand out. As the shadow of the main actor, I will make you, the light, the number one in Japan."
Listen to your seniors once in a while or I will kill you.
Fear isn't a bad thing. There are some things that can only be done by cowards.
But hating something you love is a painful feeling.

"Once you look up to someone, you can't overtake them."

"All these things you guys seek....hard work, guts, faith....I'll crush them all."
"Victory is everything in this world. The victory is acknowledged, and the vanquished is disavowed. Because I am victorious overall, I am always the just."
"I have not changed at all. There were two of me to begin with. It was merely a swap between us. I have no intent on hiding this. Whether or not you believe it is up to you, Tetsuya.
