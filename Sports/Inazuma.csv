Unnecessary thoughts will only interfere with your plays.
Certain individuals can change the entire outlook of the team with their overwhelming abilities.
This is super-dimensional soccer. (he's not freaking kidding)
My presence is thin.
"It's been a long time since I talked this much, so I felt really nervous."
I came here because I want to be a man with a more visible existence.
I want to play soccer with you Endou!
Endou! Show me the soccer I came to love!
I need to be faster.
I need more power to beat Aliea Academy.
"I'm not as strong as you, Endou."
*to Fideo* Thanks for bringing that man back to his old self.
*to Kageyama* So this is the real you.
"*to Endou* Maybe when I join your team, I may find the soccer I'm trying to find."
"When I kick the ball, I feel like I'm playing with my father."
*to Haruna* I never stopped thinking about you.
Being perfect doesn't mean I had to become Atsuya. It was to fight alongside my friends...To become one with them!
I swore with Atsuya that I would become stronger with him.
"I'll become perfect through this match. For everyone's sakes, I have to!"
I want to be useful to the team!
Coach please let me play in this match!
"I'm not perfect, I can't help anyone."
"If I stay here, nothing about me will change."
Why am I sitting here? I chose to stay with the Captain and the others so I could become perfect.
"We're getting goals, right? Just leave it to me!"
You can't win without good defense.
Let's run like the wind together.
"On Earth, there aren't any allies or enemies when the match is over."
*to Gouenji* You're always late!!
Don't mind! Don't mind!
