## Topic

**My project topic is looking at quotes from different anime and seeing if based on the language and words used if I can deduce the main genre of an anime**

I will use data that has many quotes from different anime. I will first clean the data, removing any unwanted symbols, stop words, and/or punctuation. Then, I will come up with three classes, aka genres, that are common in anime and then come up with features relative to each class. Then, I will use commands to search for these features in the quotes, mainly sed and grep, in order to classify each anime into a specific class (or genre).
